            Life Is Spiritual Publishing/Ministries (LIS) is a publishing
            company working with a non-denominational christian discipleship
            youth ministry under Faith Christian Fellowship Kenya
            www.fcfkenya.com. FCF-Kenya has a goal to see the gospel of the
            Kingdom of God spread to the entire world. The Worldshare Foundation
            is the charity arm of Life Is Spiritual Ministries. We donate food,
            clothing, healthcare, school books and education grants for orphans
            living in abject poverty, jigger removal (a parasitic insect, a type
            of mite which digs into the flesh of the feet and lodges larvae
            which hatch from the egg within one to six days) which cause extreme
            pain and are widespread in mud houses with dirt floors.

          Jiggers completely immobilise making walking impossible, children and
          the elderly are the hardest hit with jiggers. We also give sanitary
          towels for women, beds, blankets and mattresses (almost all of the
          people we donate to sleep on the dirt floors or on animal skins. We
          dig boreholes for water and process maize into maize meal and
          distribute for free to the vulnerable especially during this time of
          lockdowns amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We also sponsor medical
          procedures for emergency cases whenever we can. We combine the
          preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom of God with the work of charity
          to the poor. Touching lives in this way allows us to win the souls of
          the broken hearted and disenfranchised masses in Uganda and Kenya.
          This ministry was founded by Apostle Timsimon "Bamboo" Kimani and
          prophetess Erica Kimani.

            Tim is married to Erica Mukisa Kimani and is a family man and a man
            of God. We believe that there are many deep and wonderful truths
            hidden in the bible which God's children need to know.
            Unfortunately, many of these truths are not revealed by the
            mainstream christian church through televangelists because of the
            level of compromise and infiltration of the enemy into positions of
            media leadership. Therefore the enemy is able to conceal many of his
            deceptions to the world because his agents are some of the popular
            ministers with access to the world through the media. Now there are
            many men of God who have not been compromised however, these men
            seem to have no voice or have been silenced before they could reach
            many souls in the world with the truth.

          The body of Christ needs their own platforms where the evil arms of
          censorship and/or infiltration cannot reach. Satan's kingdom is a
          kingdom of darkness. Darkness is ignorance, therefore Satan's kingdom
          thrives on the ignorance of humanity. The more a born again human
          being declares the light of God's word, the less space the devil has
          to move around. Matthew 5:14 "Ye are the light of the world, a city
          that is set on a hill cannot be hid." These were Yeshuah's (Jesus)
          words to his disciples. A light must reveal truth. The kind of truth
          that makes one dangerous to the kingdom of darkness is the truth which
          reveals and exposes their secrets, their plans and their purposes.

          Light is what will destroy Satan's kingdom. Yeshuah is that light. The
          light of God's word and the revealing of Satan's operations is a key
          which the body of Christ must use to our advantage. If this generation
          knew what they were up against, they would be more loyal to God than
          they were to the devil. This ministry exists to reveal truth,
          dangerous truth. The kind of truth which Satan and his minions do NOT
          want God's children to know. This ministry will continue to release
          various publications such as the "Erica" series with a view to feed
          God's children with as much information as possible so as to equip
          them for the days ahead. We are in the last of the last days. We are
          the circumcision, who worship God in spirit, we rejoice in Christ
          Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh (Phil 3:3). May God bless
          your journey, and thank you for stopping by and remember, Life is
          Spiritual.
